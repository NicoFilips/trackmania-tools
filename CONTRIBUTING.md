## Project Structure

This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). This means that there are some folder conventions enforced by the framework itself (e.g. for [Next.js pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages)).

Outside of that, we have devised our own project structure as follows:

- `public` - Next.js [public assets directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving).
- `src` - Contains our source files.
  - `components` - Layout + design-system components (primarily used in Customiser).
  - `modules` - Contains core functionalities, separated by feature.
  - `pages` - Next.js [server-rendered pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages).
  - `styles` - Contains global CSS files used within the project.
  - `types` - TypeScript types used across multiple feature modules.
  - `utils` - Utility functions used across multiple feature modules.
